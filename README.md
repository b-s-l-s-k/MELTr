# MELTr
For manual visualization of live music
This program allows the user to create trippy/psychedlic visuals that go along with music either playing out of a speaker, or being performed live. 



This was created out of the need for an open-source VJ (Visual Jockey) program as the current market only contains niche products, or hyper expensive multi-faceted ones.

## GOALS:
To create a VJ program the is resource efficient, easy to use, and highly customizable. 

## Getting Started 
The current configuration is as follows ny default:

Once the program starts a white window will appear, as well as a small window. The larger white window is the rendering surface which displays the graphics generated by the program. 
Once it does, Press the SPACE bar and it will toggle the draw thread. 
For a simple test, presses the keys: / '  2 d s a SPACE  In that order, to get started. 

## CommandFrame
The CommandFrame is a seperate window launched by pressing SHIFT+ENTER after the main window appears
This window allows you to control the program via that window without keyboard input

NOTE: It is recommended that you either have a large screen, or a multi-monitor setup when using both the main window (GFrame) and the CommandFrame as both on the same screen can be unintuitive. 

Preferences/Configuration of CommandFrame is loaded from /res/custom_frame.txt
For more info about setting up a custom CommandFrame, refer to /about_custom_frame.txt

## Spout Support
As per Reddit user [scootunit](https://www.reddit.com/user/scootunit/) Spout support has been added
Credits to the code for Spout integration goes to [SpoutProcessing](https://github.com/leadedge/SpoutProcessing)

**NOTE** : *Currently Spout is ON by default. This will be changed in future commits/releases. *

For Spout to properly display the contents of GFrame, maximize the tiny window the appeas at program start.
Meltr *does not* act as a receiver, only a sender for Spout.
