For manual visualization of live music
This program allows the user to create trippy/psychedlic visuals that go along with music either playing out of a speaker, or being performed live. 

This was created out of the need for an open-source VJ (Visual Jockey) program as the current market only contains niche products, or hyper expensive multi-faceted ones.

GOALS:
To create a VJ program the is efficient, easy to use, and super customizable.
